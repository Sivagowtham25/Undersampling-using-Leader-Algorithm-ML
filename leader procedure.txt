1.Calculate pattern sum for each pattern by adding its features 
2.Arrange all patterns in ascending order based on its pattern sum 
3.Pattern of the first sum in the order is the representative for the first cluster 
4.Consider each pattern in the order one by one 
5.Compare its pattern sum with the cluster representatives one by one 
6.When it is lesser than the threshold then includes that pattern as a member of the corresponding cluster 
otherwise that pattern becomes representative of a new cluster 
7.Repeat steps 4 to 6 for all the patterns in the order 
8.Find new cluster representatives for each cluster by finding average for all patterns inside the cluster 
9.The cluster representatives are the members of the majority class.
